    <h3 > Hello ðŸ‘‹, 
        I'm Ghadeer, a computer science graduate from Al-Maaref University. After graduation, 
        I immediately engaged with DgPad.Net bootcamp training at ALBAB Creative Coworking which was for 2-months
        and then I completed a 3-months internship as an ASP.NET Core Web Developer at Alpha Technology Group.
        Following that, I continued to advance my skills and knowledge by undertaking a bootcamp at SE Factory.
        During these months, I have been exposed to a great amount of knowledge and gained skills that contributed to the growth of my career so far. In the next stage, awaiting 
        the opportunity to use all of the learned skills and information in the upcoming tasks and positions.</h3>
